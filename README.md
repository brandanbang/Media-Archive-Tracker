# My Personal Project - Entertainment Archive

My experience with consuming media has always been somewhat messy. Often, I read and watch
several things simultaneously, especially as a show is being released.
Given enough time and a multitude of series to follow, I eventually forget which episode
I was on, or even the title of the series all together.

To assist my fellow media consumers, my personal project will be a desktop application that will
aid avid show watchers and readers **_track_** and **_store_** the user's shows, movies,
books and other entertainment series. Users will be able to create entries for each series with many different tags.
Some tags include an episode/chapter tracker, a rating system, genre tags and even an option to
upload cover art. There will even be options to filter each tags; helping users find which series they have
started. Furthermore, the archive and filter system will help in giving recommendations to
friends!
