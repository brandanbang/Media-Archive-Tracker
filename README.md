# My Personal Project - **Catan**

Throughout my life, I played a good amount of tabletop games. 
One of the most memorable is Catan. 
Sometimes I want to play it, but often times my friends are out of town, and we can only play video games
together over a call. However, with my own version of Catan (and hopefully other games in the future), we can play together over a share-screen. 

To all my fellow tabletop enthusiasts, my personal project will be a desktop version of the Classic board game, Catan.
It will follow many of the **_standard rules_**; players will be able to collect resources, view overall game stats and make transactions.
At the start of the game, the 'game master' will have the options to **_customize_** and toggle certain rules - especially useful for those who dislike the robber!
